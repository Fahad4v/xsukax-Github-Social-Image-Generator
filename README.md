A powerful, privacy-focused web application that generates stunning cover images for your GitHub repositories. Create professional social media preview images with zero setup, no server requirements, and complete data privacy.

## üìñ Project Overview

The xsukax GitHub Social Image Generator is a client-side web application designed to help developers and open-source maintainers create eye-catching cover images for their GitHub repositories. By simply entering a repository URL, users can instantly generate six professionally designed cover images in different styles, each featuring the repository name, description, and owner information.

The application leverages the GitHub API to fetch repository metadata and uses HTML5 Canvas to render high-quality 1280x640 pixel images optimized for social media platforms. With over 100 unique color combinations and six distinct design templates, every generation produces fresh, vibrant results that help repositories stand out.

## üîí Security and Privacy Benefits

This application prioritizes user security and privacy through its architectural design and implementation:

- **100% Client-Side Processing**: All image generation occurs entirely in your browser with no server-side components, eliminating data transmission risks and ensuring complete user control
- **Zero Data Collection**: The application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, usage statistics, or repository data beyond the initial GitHub API request
- **No Authentication Required**: Users can generate images without creating accounts, logging in, or providing credentials, minimizing exposure of sensitive information
- **Public API Usage Only**: The application exclusively accesses publicly available repository information through GitHub's official API, respecting repository privacy settings
- **No External Dependencies**: Apart from the GitHub API, no third-party services, analytics trackers, or advertising networks are integrated, preventing data leakage
- **Local Storage Free**: The application does not utilize browser storage mechanisms (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies), ensuring no persistent tracking
- **Open Source Transparency**: As an open-source project, the entire codebase is available for security audits and community review
- **HTTPS API Calls**: All communication with GitHub's API occurs over secure HTTPS connections, protecting data in transit
- **No Build Pipeline**: The single-file architecture eliminates supply chain attack vectors common in complex build systems
